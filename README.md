# Vecty
C++ based vector editor for laser cutter.

## Coding Rules
1. Use Modern C++ as possible as you can.
2. However... do not use smart pointers on QObject
3. Use pass by reference for objects and smart pointer as you can
4. Reduce logic implementation in widgets and QML codes, to maintain low coupling with Qt Framework.
